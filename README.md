DOMAIN:DATA SCIENCE
DURATION:6 WEEKS
MENTOR:NEELA SANTHOSH
description:In Task 3 of the CodTech Data Science Internship, we were instructed to develop a complete end-to-end data science project—from data collection and preprocessing to model training and deployment using Flask or FastAPI. This task was designed to simulate a real-world data science workflow, where the final goal is to make a model accessible via a web-based API or app.

1. Problem Definition & Data Collection
We began by clearly defining the problem our model would solve. For instance, we selected a customer churn prediction problem—aiming to identify customers likely to cancel a subscription. We either used a public dataset (such as from Kaggle) or generated synthetic data using Python libraries like pandas and numpy. The data included features like age, subscription duration, billing information, and service usage.

2. Data Preprocessing
The next step involved cleaning and preprocessing the data. We handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and scaled numerical data using StandardScaler. This preprocessing ensured that the data was in a suitable format for machine learning models. All of this was implemented using pandas and scikit-learn.

3. Model Training
We then split the dataset into training and test sets and trained a machine learning model—such as a RandomForestClassifier or LogisticRegression. The model was evaluated using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These results helped us determine how well our model could predict customer churn.

4. Model Serialization
To prepare the model for deployment, we serialized it using joblib. This allowed us to save the trained model and load it later in our web application.

5. API Development with Flask
We created a simple web API using the Flask framework. The API included:

A /predict endpoint that accepted input data via JSON.

Logic to preprocess the input data the same way as during training.

The loading of the serialized model and returning predictions as a response.

The Flask app was tested locally to ensure it correctly responded to prediction requests.

6. Deployment (Optional/Advanced)
Although not mandatory, we had the option to deploy the Flask app using cloud platforms like Heroku, Render, or Streamlit Community Cloud, making the model accessible online. This helped simulate how data science models are deployed in production environments.

7. Documentation and GitHub
To complete the task, we documented our project and pushed all scripts and notebooks to a GitHub repository. This included:

data_collection.py

data_preprocessing.py

model_training.ipynb

app.py (Flask application)

requirements.txt

Conclusion
This task offered comprehensive exposure to the data science workflow. It helped strengthen our understanding of the real-world lifecycle of a data science project—from raw data to a deployed application. By integrating concepts like machine learning, data engineering, and web development, this task significantly enhanced both our technical and project management skills.
